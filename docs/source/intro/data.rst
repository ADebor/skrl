Tracking metrics (TensorBoard)
------------------------------

`TensorBoard <https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard>`_ is used for tracking and visualizing metrics and values (coefficients, losses, etc.). The tracking and writing of metrics and values is the responsibility of the agents (**can be customized independently for each agent using its configuration dictionary**)

Each agent offers the following parameters under the :literal:`"experiment"` key

.. code-block:: python
    :emphasize-lines: 5,6,7

    DEFAULT_CONFIG = {
        ...
        
        "experiment": {
            "directory": "",            # experiment's parent directory
            "experiment_name": "",      # experiment name
            "write_interval": 250,      # TensorBoard writing interval (timesteps)

            "checkpoint_interval": 1000,        # interval for checkpoints (timesteps)
            "checkpoint_policy_only": True,     # checkpoint for policy only
        }
    }

* **directory**: directory where the data generated by the experiment are stored (a subdirectory). If no value is set, the :literal:`runs` folder (inside the current working directory) will be used (and created if it does not exist)

* **experiment_name**: name of the experiment (subdirectory). If no value is set, it will be the current date and time and the agent's name (e.g. :literal:`22-01-09_22-48-49-816281_DDPG`)

* **write_interval**: interval for writing metrics and values to TensorBoard (default is 250 timesteps)

Model checkpoint
----------------

The checkpoint management, as in the previous case, is the responsibility of the agents (**can be customized independently for each agent using its configuration dictionary**)

.. code-block:: python
    :emphasize-lines: 9,10

    DEFAULT_CONFIG = {
        ...
        
        "experiment": {
            "directory": "",            # experiment's parent directory
            "experiment_name": "",      # experiment name
            "write_interval": 250,      # TensorBoard writing interval (timesteps)

            "checkpoint_interval": 1000,        # interval for checkpoints (timesteps)
            "checkpoint_policy_only": True,     # checkpoint for policy only
        }
    }
