Installation
============

Prerequisites
-------------

**skrl** requires Python 3.6 or higher and the following libraries (they will be installed automatically):

    * `gym <https://gym.openai.com/>`_
    * `torch <https://pytorch.org/>`_ 1.8.0 or higher
    * `tensorboard <https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard>`_

Library Installation
--------------------

GitHub repository
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Clone or download the library from its GitHub repository (https://github.com/Toni-SM/skrl)

    .. code-block:: bash
        
        git clone https://github.com/Toni-SM/skrl.git
        cd skrl

* **Install in editable/development mode** (links the package to its original location allowing any modifications to be reflected directly in its Python environment)

    .. code-block:: bash
        
        pip install -e .

* **Install in the current Python site-packages directory** (modifications to the code downloaded from GitHub will not be reflected in your Python environment)

    .. code-block:: bash
        
        pip install .

Python Package Index (PyPI)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

TODO: :red:`Add package to PyPI (comming soon)`
