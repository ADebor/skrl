Download model from Hugging Face Hub
------------------------------------

Several skrl-trained models (agent checkpoints) for different environments/tasks of Gym/Gymnasium, Isaac Gym, Omniverse Isaac Gym, etc. are available in the Hugging Face Hub

These models can be used as comparison benchmarks, for collecting environment transitions in memory (for offline reinforcement learning, e.g.) or for pre-initialization of agents for performing similar tasks, among others

Visit the `skrl organization on the Hugging Face Hub <https://huggingface.co/skrl>`_ to access publicly available models!
