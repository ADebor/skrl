## SKRL - Reinforcement Learning library

**skrl** is an open-source modular library for Reinforcement Learning written in Python (using [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)) and designed with a focus on readability, simplicity, and transparency of algorithm implementation

In addition to supporting the [Gym](https://gym.openai.com/) interface, it allows loading and configuring [NVIDIA Isaac Gym](https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-gym>) environments, enabling agents' simultaneous training by scopes (subsets of environments among all available environments), which may or may not share resources, in the same run
